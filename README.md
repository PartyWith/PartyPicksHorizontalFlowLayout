## Installation

`PartyPicksHorizontalFlowLayout` is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```swift
pod "PartyPicksHorizontalFlowLayout"
```

And then run:

`$ pod install`


#### Manual Installation

To manually install `PartyPicksHorizontalFlowLayout`, simply add `PartyPicksHorizontalFlowLayout` files to your project.


## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo. No Cocoapods setup needed, the files are embeded.


## Getting Start

**Via Storyboard**

You can easily set your `UICollectionView`'s Flow Layout in your storyboard:

In your `UIViewController`, you'll **need** to implement the `delegate` property:

```swift
if  let flowLayout = collection.collectionViewLayout as? PartyPicksHorizontalFlowLayout {
    // Your app will crash if you don't implement this property
    flowLayout.delegate = <#delegate here#>
}
```

**Via Code**

You can also set it in your `UIViewController`:

```swift
let flowLayout = PartyPicksHorizontalFlowLayout(delegate: self) // Delegate is required
self.collectionView.collectionViewLayout = flowLayout
```

Additionally you can configure some extra properties:

```swift
let flowLayout = PartyPicksHorizontalFlowLayout(lines: 4, delegate: self) // Delegate is required
self.collectionView.collectionViewLayout = flowLayout

flowLayout.cellSpacing = 5
flowLayout.contentInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: 0, left: 20, bottom: 0, right: 20)
```

If you chose to implement `PartyPicksHorizontalFlowLayout` via storyboard, you can custom these properties using the conditional cast operator:

```swift
if  let flowLayout = collection.collectionViewLayout as? PartyPicksHorizontalFlowLayout {
    // Customize your flow layout
    flowLayout.numberOfLines = 4
    flowLayout.cellSpacing = 5
    flowLayout.contentInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: 0, left: 20, bottom: 0, right: 20)
}
```


## Delegate

In order to work properly, `PartyPicksHorizontalFlowLayout` requires a `PartyPicksHorizontalFlowLayoutDelegate`. You'll find these methods in this protocol:

```swift
public protocol PartyPicksHorizontalFlowLayoutDelegate {
    
    /**
     * Tells the flow layout which should be the width for a given cell.
     */
    func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, widthForCellAt indexPath: IndexPath, withHeight height: CGFloat) -> CGFloat
    
    /**
     * Tells the delegate when flow layout is all set.
     */
    func didPreparedFlowLayout()
}
```

Please look into the example project for more details about the implementation.
